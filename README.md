# 🌱 Plant & Vegetable Detection using CNN  

This project is a deep learning-based plant and vegetable classification system built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model is deployed using **Streamlit**, allowing users to upload images and receive real-time predictions.

## 🚀 Features
- 📸 **Upload plant/vegetable images for classification**
- 🧠 **Trained CNN model for accurate predictions**
- 📊 **Real-time inference using Streamlit UI**
- 📈 **Uses TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning**
- 💻 **User-friendly web interface**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** – Programming language  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** – Deep learning framework  
- **Streamlit** – Web-based frontend  
- **OpenCV/Pillow** – Image preprocessing  
- **NumPy & Pandas** – Data handling  
- **Matplotlib** – visualization
